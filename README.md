## Identifying-fraudulent-transactions-using-Machine-Learning-Models

Since the introduction of e-commerce applications and the contemporary digital world, where the majority of activities are carried out online, fraudulent transactions have been on the rise. As we speak, there are numerous transactions taking place all around us, which enables us to take advantage of financial services by making purchases using credit and debit cards. Fraudulent transactions provide unauthorized users access to legitimate users' money, inflicting them financial harm. Accessibility to credit card transaction data, fraudster tactics, spotting scams in rapidly created bulk data, and uneven data are some of the main difficulties in spotting fraudulent credit card transactions. Therefore, discerning methods are required to spot fraudulent transactions.The paper deals with various machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, XGBoost to detect fraudulent transactions. Performance analysis in identifying the threshold for the model was done using Grid Search technique. Dataset consisted of highly imbalanced data and it was handled using SMOTE. The experiment shows that XGBoost was able to achieve an accuracy of 93.6\% by choosing a threshold of 0.75.
